# Diablo II - LoD "Block Penalty Fix"
Reduce block penalty when running or disable it entirely

## Details
This repository contains enough info to be able to manually patch your game with a fix.

## Explanation
The unmodified game applies a penalty to block chance when running, reducing chance to 1/3rd of its value.
One fix is about reducing the penalty so that chance to block is only halved.
An other fix is about bypassing the penalty completely.
