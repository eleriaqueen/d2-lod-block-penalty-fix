# Diablo II - LoD "Block Penalty Fix"
Reduce block penalty when running or disable it entirely

## How to use the info in this repository

Bare minimum you need a hexadecimal editor and need to know how to search for and how to modify hex values using this type of software.

Recommended hex editor : [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex)

## Explanation
The unmodified game applies a penalty to block chance when running, reducing chance to 1/3rd of its value.
You can reduce the penalty so that chance to block is only halved.
Bypassing the penalty completely an other possibility.
