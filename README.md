# Diablo II - LoD "Block Penalty Fix"
Reduce block penalty when running or disable it entirely

## How to use the info in this repository

Bare minimum you need a hexadecimal editor and need to know how to search for and how to modify hex values using this type of software.

Recommended hex editor : [ImHex](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex)

## Explanation
The unmodified game reduces block chance while running to one third of its value.
With the information in this repository you can reduce the penalty so that it is only halved,
or bypass the penalty completely.
